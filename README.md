__Update 06.09.2018__: karmabot now supports commands, add them to the `commands/` subdirectory, then import it to `bot/slack.py` and add it to `BOT_COMMANDS`. More info: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx9qYl6lmzM&amp;t=2s

__Update 01.11.2018__: depending the type of commands you contribute, we merge it into master (= @karmabot revision used on our Slack). For more general purpose commands, not directly relevant to our @karmabot / Slack community, we made a [_utils_ branch](https://github.com/pybites/karmabot/tree/utils). We will merge those type of commands into that branch.
